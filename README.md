# Awesome client-only boilerplate

This is a modern react / redux application with both hmr and static index.html that can be hosted in any external server (or example apache / ngix ) even while developement. Beause yes, webpack magic is cool, but when dealing with really custom projects, it simply sucks. 

The HMR client is here truly indepent to its server.
